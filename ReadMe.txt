For the frontend, I used JSON Server for the backend.
 To get started with the backend, you should execute the following command:
	-  json-server --watch db.json

After running the command, you can access data related to items and users through the following endpoints:

Items: http://localhost:3000/items
Users: http://localhost:3000/users


To launch the Angular app, use the command:
-  ng serve
